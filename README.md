# Diabetes Classification Model using Logistic Regression
It is estimated that 415 million people are living with diabetes in the world, which is estimated to be 1 in 11 of the world's adult population. 46% of people with diabetes are undiagnosed.

As part of the Coders of Colour Computer Vision course we were taught about many different machine learning algorithms and how they can be used to solve real world problems. For the classification practical I chose to explore a diabetes dataset containing the most common symptoms of a diabetic. My model was able to figure out tha 'Polyuria' and 'Polydisia' were the most common indicators of having diabetes.

The approach I took to solve this task was:
<!-- <ol>
  <li>Retrieve my dataset fron kaggle.</li>
  <li>Calculate a score for each of the positions.</li>
  <li>Move the block to the position with the highest score and repeat.</li>
</ol>

The python libraries I used were pandas, numpy, sklearn, seaborn and matplotlib. -->

## Dataset ##
Data uploaded to AWS S3 - https://diabetes-data-mka.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/diabetes_data_upload.csv

## Setup ##
<!-- All of the code was only tested using Python 3.7.0 so I'd recommend using it as well. Before starting, setup a virtual environment and within that environment, install the dependencies. All dependancies are included in requirements.txt (created using pipreqs) <br />
```
pip install requirements.txt
``` -->

## Usage ##
<!-- Run the game by running tetris.py
```
python tetris.py
```
<br />To DISABLE the autoplayer, go to `te_settings.py`and set the boolean variable `DEFAULT_AUTOPLAY` to `false`
<br />Controls:
<br />`a`- Move Left
<br />`s`- Move Right
<br />`k`- Rotate Left
<br />`l`- Rotate Right
<br />`space`- Hard drop
<br /><strong>Compatibility: python version 3.7.0 or later</strong> -->
